Utilizing NASA Open API - https://api.nasa.gov/

```
Technologies I Used:
1. Windows 10, Microsoft IIS, PHP, WinCache, Fast CGI, OpenSSL (For Local)
2. CPanel, PHP, OpenSSL, CGI (For Remote)

For remote,
You can also try it from Windows Server (or Azure) if you have bought one on your own. 
For remote hosting, you need to purchase public IP and configure them.
Or if you already have static IP in router, then you can configure and use that maybe.
