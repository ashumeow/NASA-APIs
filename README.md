# NASA-APIs
Utilizing and Experimenting with NASA Open API - https://api.nasa.gov/

```
Technologies I Used:
1. Windows 10, Microsoft IIS, PHP, WinCache, Fast CGI, OpenSSL (For Local)
2. CPanel (3rd party), PHP, OpenSSL, CGI (For Remote)
```

```
For local (alternative options),
You can run it in XAMPP (or) Apache directly using VirtualBox (Docker/Vagrant) too instead of IIS.
```

```
For remote (alternative options),
You can also try it from Windows Server (or Azure) if you have bought one on your own. 
For remote hosting, you need to purchase public IP and configure them.
Or if you already have static IP in router, then you can configure and use that maybe.
Or buy 3rd party web domain/hosting

If you don't have any, then you can host it as Github Pages after forking this repo (or new repo) from Settings.
